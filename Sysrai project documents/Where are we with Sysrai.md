**Where are we?**  
**All the files are in the right place in GitHub according to the file layout below. Next Step, set up Digital Ocean.**

**Below is the whole previous conversation from Claude (web). It is trying to use RunPod only for video work and the rest of the project is on Digital Ocean. This clamps the costs further down BECAUSE there is a script which shuts down the server when not used. This is a big saving when there is not much video creation going on.**  
**This hosts on Digital Ocean and only used RunPod for video via APIâ€™s**

The below is from the previous Claude conversation in this project. The Sysrai AI Movie platform complete project is attached. I have really struggled with RunPod and setting that up for Sysrai project. And it is expensive (GPU cost all the time even though I am not using them; I would like GPU cost only when they are needed. Maybe with API we can trigger start-stop of the Pods, maybe even start-stop several pods when usage is high?) I want you to tell me \-in very simple terms (treat me like you would an idiot), what to click etc to configure RunPods and then Digital Ocean.

I've created a comprehensive project plan that covers everything we've discussed and the new simplified approach. Here are the key points to continue with:  
Immediate Next Steps for New Conversation:  
1\. SkyReels API Setup on RunPod (much simpler than full platform)  
   \* Single-purpose GPU pod just for video generation  
   \* Simple API wrapper around SkyReels  
   \* Only runs when generating videos  
2\. Main Platform on Regular Hosting  
   \* DigitalOcean ($5/month) or similar  
   \* Normal web development workflow  
   \* Calls RunPod API only when needed  
Key Benefits of New Approach:  
\* âœ… 95% cost reduction (GPU only when generating videos)  
\* âœ… Simpler development (standard web hosting)  
\* âœ… Better scaling (independent components)  
\* âœ… Easier maintenance (separate concerns)  
What to Tell Next Claude:  
*"I'm building Sysrai, an AI movie platform that creates films for $250 instead of $50M. We decided to use split architecture: main platform on regular hosting \+ SkyReels API on RunPod GPU for video generation only. I have the complete project plan and need help implementing the SkyReels API service on RunPod first, then the main platform. Start with setting up a simple SkyReels API wrapper on RunPod."*  
The markdown file contains everything: architecture, costs, timeline, technical specs, and implementation details. This approach will be much more successful and cost-effective\!  
Edit  
I'll help you set up the Sysrai platform with a practical, step-by-step approach. Based on your documents, I can see you want to build an AI movie creation platform where users can create films for $250 instead of $50M using SkyReels V2. Let me break this down into simple, actionable steps.

## **Overview: What We're Building**

Sysrai Platform Architecture:

* Main Platform: DigitalOcean hosting ($5/month) \- handles users, payments, projects  
* SkyReels API: RunPod GPU (only when generating videos) \- creates the actual videos  
* Cost: GPU only runs when making videos \= 95% cost savings

## **Step 1: GitHub Repository Setup**

First, let's get your code organized:  
GitHub Repository Setup Guide
